. Post-processing transliteration
If the above doesnâ€™t produce English words in Nepali script, you can:

Extract English parts from the transcript.

Use a transliteration library or API (e.g., googletrans or Indic transliteration tools) to convert English text to Nepali script.




Step-by-step plan:
Transcribe the audio forcing Nepali language (so Nepali parts are properly transcribed).

Detect English words/phrases in the transcript.

Transliterate those English words into Nepali script using a transliteration tool or API.

Replace English parts with their Nepali transliterations in the final transcript.
